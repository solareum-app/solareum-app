**Solareum Wallet**  

This is a crypto wallet developed specifically for Solana. Built with React Native, it is available on both Android and iOS, with over 100K downloads across both platforms. Solareum Wallet enables users to interact with the Solana blockchain, facilitating token transfers and transactions. 

This project has given me a deeper understanding of how a crypto wallet functions and how it interacts with the blockchain. Additionally, it has helped me tackle challenges related to handling high and sudden traffic spikes.
